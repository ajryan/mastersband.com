<b>The Story</b><br> <br>The three members of MOTU grew up in
Frederick, Maryland. Each member, coming from very different musical
backgrounds, had no idea that they would come together after graduating
from college and would form one of the most flexible bands in
Frederick. Why the name Masters of the Universe? At first thought, you
may think that they're narcissistic egomaniacs. Quite frankly, they are
and it comes through in their music. MOTU's main goal is to rock any
venue, whether it be the smokey, gritty bar scene to the lavish
acoustical coffee houses. They pride themselves with their original
compositions, but they also put a lot of work in picking their covers.
MOTU enjoys playing classic hits such as Jimi Hendrix to awesome
eighties anthems such as Fine Young Cannonballs. They currently perform
all over MD,VA, and DC. <br><br><Br></td></tr>
<tr><td><h5>Drums - Kelly Mills</h5>
<img src="kelly1.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 3px;"></td><td><span style="font-size: 13px; ">Kelly has been hitting the skins since middle school, when he fell in love
with jazz greats such as Billy Cobham, Buddy Rich, and Max Roach.  Rock
lessons through high school and jazz lessons in college set him up to fall
in love with funk and it's faster, jazzier cousin, fusion.  A few of his
eclectic musical influences are Mike Clark (Headhunters), Herbie Hancock,
George Benson, Stevie Wonder, Paul Chambers, George Gershwin,  Steely Dan,
The Talking Heads, Radiohead, Beck, George Clinton and Parliament
Funkadelic, The Rza, the Pixies, and the Beatles.  His favorite producers
are Teo Macero, Rick Rubin, Nigel Godrich, Dan the Automator, Amon Tobin,
and DJ shadow.  Kelly lives in Gaithersburg, Md. and is in the process of
moving to Baltimore, Md.</span></td></tr>

<img src="bing_e.jpg" style="float: left; margin-left: 3px;"></td><td><span style="font-size: 13px;">Bing
Kung does not have a lot of facial hair. He shaves about once every two
weeks. Instead of growing stubble, his face grows whiskers. When the
whiskers get long enough, he will pluck and tune them to the right
frequencies and use them on his guitar. You can hear these magical
whiskers used in various songs in the <a href="http://mastersband.com/media.htm">Media</a> section of the website.<br><br></span></td></tr>

<h5 style="clear: both; display: block;">Vocals/Guitar/Bass - Aidan Ryan</h5>
<img width:80="" height:80="" src="aidan_e.jpg" style="float: left; margin-right: 3px;"></td><td><span style="font-size: 13px;">Aidan learned John Prine and The Band songs from his dad
growing up. He played in coffee houses around his college town of
Baltimore, honing a raw delivery and obscure lyrical bent. When not
teaching Tech Ed in 7th grade he can be found listening to Bob Dylan,
Warren Zevon, Neil Young, and Yo La Tengo.</td></tr></table><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>&nbsp;</span></div>
